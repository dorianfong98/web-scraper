<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This is a Web Scraper application built to extract data from any web page quickly and accurately.

This particular application I have coded specifically extracts headlines and article links from UK news source The Guardian, but you may modify and adapt the code accordingly for any other Website's HTML elements.

## Getting Started

To get started using the application, simply download the .zip file and open the web-scraper.exe executable. 

Note: As this file runs on PORT 3000, make sure that it is not already in use. 
To check and kill processes running on the port:

For **Linux/Mac OS** search (sudo) run this in the terminal:

`$ lsof -i tcp:3000` 
`$ kill -9 PID`

On **Windows**:

`netstat -ano | findstr :3000`
`tskill typeyourPIDhere`
